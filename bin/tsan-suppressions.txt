# TSAN and Java don't play nicely together because JVM code is not instrumented with
# TSAN. TSAN requires all libs to be compiled with '-fsanitize=thread' (see
# https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerCppManual#non-instrumented-code),
# which is not currently possible for Java code. See
# https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/tsan/Main and JDK-8208520 for efforts to get TSAN
# to run against Java code.
